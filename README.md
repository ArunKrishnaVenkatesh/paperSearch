# 🧪 paperSearch

**paperSearch** is a lightweight, browser-based academic meta-search tool.
Enter a query once and instantly open searches across multiple research databases—no backend, installs, or APIs required.

## 🚀 Motivation

paperSearch simplifies the process of searching multiple databases by avoiding:

* servers or API keys
* dashboards and complex setup
* repeating the same search on different sites
* **juggling multiple tabs manually**

It generates direct search links from a single input.

## 🧩 How It Works

* reads your query in the browser
* URL-encodes it
* inserts it into platform-specific search URLs

All processing happens locally.

## ⚠️ Limitations

paperSearch does **not**:

* fetch results directly
* scrape sites
* store data
* bypass paywalls

It only generates links.
